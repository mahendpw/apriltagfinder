# apriltagfinder
apriltag finder with simple cmake build system.

Currently available build needs pod build system which complicates things unnecessarily. So this project is started to simplify the build system and also optimize the algorithm.

Thanks to the original creator of this algorithm.
Original library can be found in the link-> http://people.csail.mit.edu/kaess/apriltags/

This project is just to make the library better. Thanks again to the original creator (The APRIL Robotics Laboratory at the University of Michigan investigates Autonomy, Perception, Robotics, Interfaces, and Learning, and is part of the Computer Science and Engineering department. It is led by Associate Professor Edwin Olson.)
